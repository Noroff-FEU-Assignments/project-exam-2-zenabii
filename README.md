## Information

This Holidaze project is a tourist website where the user can book hotels and send enquiries about exploring different activities during their stay in Iceland. So this is not a site about Bergen, but Iceland instead after checking with tutors.

Use npm install to get all the packages necessary to get started with this project.

Big thanks to the teachers who responded fast when I had questions about the brief.
Thanks to Sophie for helping me out with the strapi 500 response headache.
Thanks to Maria Holm for rubberducking when necessary.
